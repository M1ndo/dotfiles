# My Awesome;Xmonad;HerbstluftWm Configuration
**Awesome** And **Xmonad** And **HerbstluftWm** are highly configurable, All are tiling window managers for X. They are very fast, extensible and licensed under the GNU GPL 2&3 license.  **Awesome** is a perfect "first" tiling window manager for those who want to try out tiling, but the extreme customization that you can achieve with awesome makes it a power user's dream.  Awesome is written In Lua It's Pretty Easy to get in to it and in case you got issues with something there's always a great documentation that has almost anything, **Xmonad** Is Not That Hard but it's quiet challenging if you're not into the haskell programming language you might take alot of time configuring Xmonad And You might face issues ,but there's always documentation available and great community!.
**HerbstluftWm** Is Magnificent , it's one of the best window managers out there and it has probably the best documentation explaining every phase , when it comes to configuring **HerbstluftWm** you can write the config in any language bash,python,haskel whatever (It's the best).

# My Keybindings For Awesome WM

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.
